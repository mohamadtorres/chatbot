                <b>SwecoDeep</b> is an advanced AI capable of understanding and generating human-like text. Use it for tasks such as drafting emails, creating content, and answering questions. Please use this service in an ethical way. Do not share confidential information from Sweco, clients or other parties without consent from the information owner. Respect the privacy of others in accordance with Sweco's privacy policies and procedures. It is for example not allowed to use the service to process sensitive client data, HR data or other sensitive data about employees. It's proficient in many topics, but its knowledge is based on information available up until April 2023. Limitations include inability to access real-time data, understand new events post-training, and provide personal advice. SwecoDeep may occasionally generate incorrect or outdated information. It learns from a broad array of sources, some of which may contain inaccuracies. It can't validate or fact-check information in real-time. Always cross-verify critical information from trusted sources and apply your judgment when using AI-generated content.<br>

                4. Documents should only be uploaded for the intended purpose of SwecoDeep. The intended purpose is to use GPT prompts regularly on the document contents.<br>
                
                5. If a folder has not been activated for 45 days, an email will be sent to the user that the folder and contents will be deleted in 30 days, a reminder email will be sent after 10 more days if it is not activated or deleted, a reminder email will be sent after 10 further days if it is not activated or deleted, a final reminder email will be sent 7 days after with final warning of deletion in 3 days time.<br>
                
                6. The folder will be unindexed and then native files archived for 30 further days and then deleted, after this the documents will be unrecoverable.<br>
                
                7. The policy is the same for shared folders.
